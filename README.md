# Parkour Flow Generator

Parkour Flow Generator was designed with parkour and freerunning athletes in mind. It generates combos for the user in a couple different ways so they can have fun with their friends or alone trying funny or creative combos. There are more than 600 parkour, freerunning, breakdancing, tricking, modifiers and more in this app, each with video resources.

## Modes

There are two different modes to generate combos. The first is probably the most useful, and we'll just call it Custom mode. In Custom mode, athletes can add categories of moves to their line. For example, they may want a line that consists of a flip -> breakdancing move -> dismount trick -> flow move -> vault -> wall trick, in that order. They can do this no problem using custom mode. Once they click the generate button, it will give them a combo in that order with a random move chosen for each category. 

The second method is Random mode. In this mode, all the ahtlete does is specify the number of moves in the combo, and it generated a line with random categories. This can be useful for fun games or youtube challenges.

In addition to this, there are modifiers they can apply. Some of these are fun like "eyes-closed" while others are more practical like "nike pose". These modifiers can be added after a category selection in order to make the move more difficult. 

So what if they don't like the combo they generated? Luckily, there are many ways to deal with this. They can regenerate the whole combo with the same parameters at the touch of a button. They can also swap individual moves for a new move in the category or switch a category if they want to. On top of this, they can keep adding random moves to the end of the line, if they're playing a game where the generation needs to be more progressive. 

What if they invent new tricks they want to add to the app or one is missing? This is simple, they can add whatever trick they want with a description and even add a link to a youtube or tiktok video showcasing the move. 

What if the athlete doesn't recognize a move? They simply tap for more information on the move and can see a description and a video link to youtube with either a full tutorial or an example of the trick. For new moves that they don't add a link to, the app automatically generates a link that searches that move in youtube just in case it does exist and they forgot to add it or didn't want to go through the trouble of adding a video resource. 

What if they can't do certain tricks any don't want them to generate ever? In this case they just go into the categories and moves list and uncheck them, thereby making them not appear in generation.

As you can see, the app is very diverse and practical specifically for athletes in the sport. It even could serve as a way for people to progress and learn different tricks and add them to their skillset since many of the links are tutorials for different moves. 

All in all, I hope this provides a good opportunity for growth, good, funny, and creative memories for athletes and people learning.
