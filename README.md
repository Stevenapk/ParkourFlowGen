# Parkour Flow Generator

Parkour Flow Generator was designed with parkour and freerunning athletes in mind. It generates combos for the user in a couple different ways so they can have fun with their friends or alone trying funny or creative combos. 

There are more than 300+ moves with tutorials in 9 categories (parkour, freerunning, breakdancing, tricking, modifiers, vaults and more) in this app.

## Modes

There are two different modes to generate combos. They can be swiped between depending on the needs of the user.

### Custom Mode
This is the mode with the most utility for athletes. In Custom mode, athletes can add categories of moves to the lineup. For example, they may want a line that consists of a flip -> breakdancing move -> dismount trick -> flow move -> vault -> wall trick, in that order. They can do this no problem using custom mode. Once they tap the generate button, it will give them a combo in that order with a random move chosen for each category. 

### Random Mode
This is the more party-game-type mode you might try with friends. In Random mode, the user toggles the number of moves in the combo. Once they tap generate, it creates a line with random categories in a random order with random moves. This can be useful for fun games or youtube challenges.

## Additional Features
### Modifiers
In addition to this, users can apply modifiers. Some of these are fun like "eyes-closed" while others are more practical like "nike pose". These modifiers can be added after a category selection in order to make a move more difficult or just to try really funny things.

### Re-generation Options
So what if they don't like the combo they generated? Luckily, there are many ways to deal with this. They can regenerate the whole combo with the same parameters at the touch of a button. They can also swap individual moves for a new move in the category or switch a category for a new one completely if they want to. On top of this, they can keep adding random moves to the end of the line, if they're playing a game where the generation needs to be more progressive. 

### Adding New Tricks
What if they invent new tricks they want to add to the app or one is missing? This is simple, they can add whatever trick they want with a description and even add a link to a youtube or tiktok video showcasing the move. 

### Learning New Tricks // Resources
What if the athlete doesn't recognize a move? They simply tap for more information on the move and can see a description and a video link to youtube with either a full tutorial or an example of the trick. For new moves that they don't add a link to, the app automatically generates a link that searches that move in youtube just in case it does exist and they forgot to add it or didn't want to go through the trouble of adding a video resource. 

### Disabling certain moves from the list
What if they can't do certain tricks and thus, don't want them to show up in generations? In this case they just go into the categories and moves list and uncheck them, thereby making them not appear in generation.

## Conclusion
As you can see, the app is very diverse and practical specifically for athletes in the sport. It even could serve as a way for people to progress and learn different tricks and add them to their skillset since many of the links for different moves lead to full-blown tutorials. 

All in all, I hope this provides a good opportunity for growth, as well as good, funny, and creative memories for athletes and people eager to learn.
